# ✨ Lumi

**Lumi** is a **virtual operating system experience inside an Android app**, built with **Jetpack
Compose**.
It brings together multiple system-style apps under a single interface, designed to feel cohesive,
minimal, and intentional.

Lumi is not a launcher replacement — it is an **OS-inspired environment**, where each feature
behaves like a built-in system app rather than a standalone tool.

---

## 🌌 Concept

Lumi is built around the idea of **one app, many system experiences**.

Instead of switching between unrelated applications, Lumi provides:

- A unified visual identity
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Shared system behavior across features

Each feature is treated as a **system component**, not just a screen.

The goal is to explore how far modern Android tools — especially **Jetpack Compose** — can go in
creating an OS-like experience within a single application.

## 🎯 Philosophy

- Minimal, distraction-free UI
- Clear separation between system logic and features
- Design-first approach
- Built for experimentation and learning

Lumi values **cohesion over complexity** and **experience over excess features**.

---

## 🧪 What Lumi Is

- A sandbox for modern Android development
- A Compose-first experiment
- A personal take on what a lightweight mobile OS could feel like

Lumi is designed to evolve naturally as ideas take shape.
